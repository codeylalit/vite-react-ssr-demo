              When co-founders Ritu Mehrotra and Sourav Banerjee battled their own mental-health
              hurdles, they hit a broken system: scarce clinicians, sky-high costs, and black-box
              AI. So they built United We Careâ€”a platform powered by a home-grown speech engine and
              the world's largest clinical knowledge graph, proving precision doesn't need Big-Tech
              budgets.

              voice, language, and reasoning at the edge.
